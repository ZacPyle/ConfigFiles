# Configuration file for screen.  Makes each window a login shell that has a
# decent amount of scrollback history and provides visual cues for the user to
# understand where they are/what they're doing.  A number of potentially
# surprising keys (e.g. kill windows and log out) are unbound as well.
#
# NOTE: Should you use this, be aware that the prefix key is rebound from
#       C-a to C-j.

# ---------------------------
# Miscellaneous Configuration
# ---------------------------

# make the shell in every window a login shell.
shell -$SHELL

# allow for 10,000 lines of scrollback buffer.  if we need to go back into
# the output history, we usually want a *lot* of it and we probably have
# memory to spare these days.
defscrollback 10000

# turn beeps into flashes.
vbell on

# detach on hangup.
autodetach on

# suppress the copyright page on startup.
startup_message off

# advertise hardstatus support to $TERMCAP.
termcapinfo  * '' 'hs:ts=\E_:fs=\E\\:ds=\E_\E\\'

# pretend we're an xterm so that random applications we're running won't
# get confused and complain about a less than functional terminal window.
term xterm

# ensure that our last line always provides basic information about the
# current window and who/where we are in the world.  something like so:
#
#   0 Emacs [user@host:/path/to/current]
caption always "%3n %t%? @%u%?%? [%h]%?"

# ------------
# Key Bindings
# ------------

# spare the sanity of Emacs users by moving the default prefix key to
# something rarely used (from an Emacs user's perspective).
escape ^Jj

# make it harder to kill the current window by rebinding it to C-K.
bind k
bind ^k
bind 'K' kill

# I've never found a good reason to kill all of the windows and jetison the
# current instance, so unbind it so we don't accidentally stumble across it.
bind \\

# prevent accidentally creating files on disk (termcap copy, hard copies,
# logs, etc).
